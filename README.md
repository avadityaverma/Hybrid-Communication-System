Hybrid Communication System
The Hybrid Communication System project is designed to enhance data transmission security by implementing a hybrid cryptographic approach. By combining Vigenère and Polybius ciphers, the system offers improved protection against unauthorized access, helping maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during online communication.
Project Overview
Cryptography is essential for safeguarding information in today’s digital age. This project addresses modern cybersecurity needs by integrating lightweight cryptographic techniques into a hybrid system that encrypts data before transmission and decrypts it upon reception, ensuring secure communication over the internet.
Project Objectives:
•	Address critical security concerns associated with online data transmission.
•	Develop an efficient hybrid encryption algorithm that combines the strengths of Vigenère and Polybius ciphers.
•	Provide a reliable encryption method resistant to cyber threats, optimizing security for sensitive data exchanges.
Key Features
1.	Hybrid Encryption: Combines Vigenère and Polybius ciphers to secure data transmissions, enhancing resistance to common cryptographic attacks.
2.	Efficiency: Optimized for fast encryption and decryption, making it suitable for real-time communication systems.
3.	User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple GUI that enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages easily.
4.	Comparative Analysis: Measures the efficiency of the hybrid algorithm against single encryption techniques, emphasizing execution time and security benefits.

Comparative Analysis:
